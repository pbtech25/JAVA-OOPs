# JAVA-OOPs
This repository documents my journey in learning Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It includes examples, exercises, and projects covering key OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Each section aims to build a solid foundation for developing robust Java applications.

# Important Notes

## Remember that... üß†
- The dot (.) is used to access the object's attributes and methods.
- To call a method in Java, write the method name followed by a set of parentheses (), followed by a semicolon (;).
- A class must have a matching filename (Main and Main.java).

## Java Constructor üèóÔ∏è
- special method, used to initialize objects.
- constructor name **must match the class name**, it cannot have a **return type** (like **void**).
- constructor is called **only** when the object is created.
- All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you. However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.
- can also take parameters, used to initialize attributes.
