# JAVA-OOPs
This repository documents my journey in learning Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It includes examples, exercises, and projects covering key OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction. Each section aims to build a solid foundation for developing robust Java applications.
